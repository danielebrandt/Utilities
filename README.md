This repository provide some utilities functions of Paleomagnetism, provided in [`Dani_utilities_for_Git.py`](https://github.com/danielebrandt/Utilities/blob/master/Dani_utilities_for_Git.py).

A jupyter notebook [`VGPSandDispersionS.ipynb`](https://github.com/danielebrandt/Utilities/blob/master/VGPSandDispersionS.ipynb) 
ilustrates how to use these functions.
